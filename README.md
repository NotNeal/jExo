This mod is currently in development, feel free to poke around, take code (would be nice to know in advance, but don't be creating accounts just to do so :), you could also message me here: http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?members/jordan.512/ ), use images (please do ask the original artists or myself for permission, but it should always be a yes) and submit pull requests for things that are taking too long, working too inefficiently or whatever.
